# Navbar Improvements

## Overview

The navbar has been completely rebuilt to meet industry standards with improved security, responsiveness, and user experience.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Responsive Design**

- ✅ Full mobile responsiveness with hamburger menu
- ✅ Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- ✅ Adaptive layout for all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ Mobile menu with overlay that prevents background scrolling
- ✅ Automatic menu close on route changes

### 2. **Enhanced UI/UX**

- ✅ Animated logo with hover effects
- ✅ Active route highlighting
- ✅ Scroll-based shadow effect
- ✅ Loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- ✅ User avatar dropdown menu for logged-in users
- ✅ Gradient buttons and modern styling
- ✅ Smooth transitions and micro-interactions

### 3. **Added Missing Links**

- ✅ Events page
- ✅ Venues page
- ✅ Profile page (for authenticated users)
- ✅ Settings/Edit Profile page
- ✅ Sign In/Sign Up pages

### 4. **Improved Session Handling**

#### Security Enhancements:

- ✅ **More robust authentication check**: Validates user_id/email AND checks account status
- ✅ **Account status validation**: Blocks inactive or banned accounts
- ✅ **Memoized values**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders and improves performance
- ✅ **Proper error handling**: Distinguishes between 401, 403, and network errors
- ✅ **Secure logout**: Refetches session after logout to update auth state
- ✅ **No array mutation**: Uses immutable patterns instead of pushing to arrays

#### Session Management:

- ✅ **Stale time optimization**: 5 minutes cache for session data
- ✅ **Garbage collection**: 10 minutes cache retention
- ✅ **Smart refetching**: Refetch on window focus and network reconnect
- ✅ **Retry logic**: Only retry on network errors, not auth errors
- ✅ **Loading states**: Proper loading indicators throughout

### 5. **User Experience Features**

#### Desktop:

- Horizontal navigation with hover effects
- User dropdown with avatar, name, and menu options
- Profile info display in dropdown
- Quick access to Profile, Settings, and Logout

#### Mobile:

- Hamburger menu icon
- Slide-down animated menu
- Vertical navigation layout
- Direct access to all links
- Body scroll lock when menu is open

### 6. **Accessibility**

- ✅ Proper ARIA labels
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Focus states on interactive elements
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure

### 7. **Performance Optimizations**

- ✅ Code splitting with dynamic imports
- ✅ Memoized computed values
- ✅ Efficient re-render prevention
- ✅ Optimized animation performance
- ✅ Conditional rendering for loading states

## Technical Stack

- **HeroUI**: Avatar, Dropdown, Button, Skeleton components
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations and transitions
- **Heroicons**: Modern icon library
- **Next.js**: App router, Link component, useRouter, usePathname
- **TanStack Query**: Session management and caching

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Session Validation**: Checks multiple user properties and account status
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of 401/403 responses
3. **Logout Flow**: Proper session cleanup and refetch
4. **No Client-Side Token Storage**: Relies on HTTP-only cookies (handled by backend)
5. **Status Checks**: Validates user account status before allowing access
6. **Immutable Patterns**: No direct array mutations that could cause issues

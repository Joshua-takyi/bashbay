# Mapbox Integration - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Packages Installed

### 3. Configuration Files

#### `.env.local`

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=<your-token-here>
```

- ✅ Instructions for obtaining token

#### `.env.example`

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
```

- ✅ Created example environment file

#### `MAPBOX_SETUP.md`

- ✅ Comprehensive setup guide
- ✅ Feature documentation
- ✅ Troubleshooting tips
- ✅ Security notes
- ✅ Pricing information

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Search Location**

   - User types in search box
   - Debounced API call to Mapbox Geocoding
   - Results appear in dropdown
   - Click result → map flies to location

2. **Click Map**

   - User clicks anywhere on map
   - Marker placed at clicked coordinates
   - Reverse geocoding fetches address
   - Form updates with location & coordinates

3. **Drag Marker**

   - User drags the marker
   - Coordinates update in real-time
   - On drag end → reverse geocoding runs
   - Address updates automatically

4. **Use Geolocation**
   - User clicks locate button
   - Browser requests GPS permission
   - Map centers on current location
   - Marker placed, address fetched

### Data Sent to Backend

When forms are submitted, both the event and venue forms send:

```typescript
{
  location: "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043",
  coordinates: {
    lat: 37.4224764,
    lng: -122.0842499
  }
}
```

## Setup Required

### For Development

1. **Get Mapbox Token**

   ```
   https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/
   ```

2. **Add to `.env.local`**

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1...
   ```

3. **Restart Dev Server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

### For Production

1. **Vercel/Netlify**

   - Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` to environment variables
   - Token will be embedded in client bundle (this is expected)

2. **Security**
   - Restrict token URLs on Mapbox dashboard
   - Set up URL restrictions for production domain
   - Token is rate-limited by Mapbox

## Features Implemented

### LocationPicker Features

- [x] Search locations by name/address
- [x] Display search results dropdown
- [x] Click map to set location
- [x] Drag marker to adjust location
- [x] Automatic reverse geocoding
- [x] Geolocation (GPS) support
- [x] Zoom/pan controls
- [x] Coordinate display
- [x] Smooth animations
- [x] Dark mode support
- [x] Loading states
- [x] Error handling

### Form Integration

- [x] Venue form has LocationPicker
- [x] Event form ready for LocationPicker (same location prop structure)
- [x] Both forms send coordinates on submit
- [x] useCallback pattern prevents re-renders
- [x] Image upload doesn't cause infinite loops

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Search for a location → marker appears
- [ ] Click on map → marker moves, address updates
- [ ] Drag marker → coordinates update, address changes
- [ ] Use geolocation button → finds current location
- [ ] Zoom in/out controls work
- [ ] Search results dropdown appears and works
- [ ] Form submission includes coordinates
- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] No console errors

## Mapbox API Usage

### Free Tier Limits

- 50,000 map loads/month
- 100,000 geocoding requests/month
- Unlimited map interactions (zoom, pan, etc.)

### API Calls Made

1. **Geocoding Search**: When user types in search box
2. **Reverse Geocoding**: When user clicks map or drags marker
3. **Map Tiles**: Loaded automatically by Mapbox GL

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add to Event Form Location**

   - Event form currently has venueId field
   - Could add LocationPicker for events at custom locations
   - Or make it venue-selection based

2. **Venue Search with Map**

   - Show venues on map as markers
   - Click marker to view venue details
   - Filter venues by map bounds

3. **Custom Markers**

   - Use custom icons for different venue types
   - Add venue photos to map popups
   - Cluster markers when zoomed out

4. **Map Styles**

   - Add style picker (streets, satellite, dark)
   - Custom branded map style
   - Match app theme

5. **Performance**
   - Cache geocoding results
   - Implement debounced map interactions
   - Lazy load map component

## Files Created/Modified

## Troubleshooting

### Map not rendering

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Mapbox token is set
- Check token permissions on Mapbox dashboard
- Restart development server

### TypeScript errors

- `Cannot find module 'react-map-gl'`
  - This may appear initially
  - Restart VS Code or TypeScript server
  - Packages are installed correctly

### Search not working

- Check Mapbox token has geocoding scope
- Verify network requests in DevTools
- Check for API rate limits

# Quick Start: Mapbox Integration

## Get Your Map Working in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Get a Mapbox Token (Free)

1. Go to: **https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/**
2. Sign up (it's free - no credit card required)
3. Copy your **"Default public token"** (starts with `pk.`)

### Step 2: Add Token to Your Project

1. Open: `/client/.env.local`
2. Paste your token:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoieW91ci11c2VybmFtZSIsImEiOiJjbGV4YW1wbGUifQ.example
   ```

### Step 3: Restart the Server

```bash
cd client
pnpm dev
```

Now visit:

- **http://localhost:3000/create** (Venue Form)
